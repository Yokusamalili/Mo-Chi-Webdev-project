My name is Chi Mo and I'm graduating in this summer and Web Dev is my last class in college. My major is information science and I had done two co-ops, one was at Harvard School of Public Health as an IT specialist and the second was at Dell EMC as a software engineer. I had done projects for OOD, Network, HCI and some other CS classes.

This repository is for Web Development class in Summer 1 2017.
